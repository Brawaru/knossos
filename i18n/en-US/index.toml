# This file contains all the source strings.
#
# When adding the strings please follow the structure of the file, that is:
#
#  - All root (top) tables are generaly sorted alphabetically.
#
#  - Underlying tables and keys can be in any order that makes it easier to
#     follow within the correspending file. If is not bound to the file, then
#     it makes sense to also sort it alphabetically to find keys quicker.
#
#  - Don't worry *too much* about your translation keys length, but also don't
#     put the whole sentences in them. Like variable names, try to provide as
#     much context as possible through them while being brief.
#
#  - Crowdin is working on adding context comments, these are comments that go
#     before the key, so if you are going to leave comments, then either break
#     the line before the key, or leave them right after the key, like:
#
#     something = "hello" # This comment won't be on Crowdin.
#
#     # Contents of this comment will be shown on Crowdin.
#     something-else = "hello world"
#
#  - Please avoid re-using translation keys except where you can be absolutely
#     sure they will stay the same no matter the context. It's better to
#     duplicate a string rather than leaving translators asking for a split.
#
#     Translators have tools to easily fill in translations for duplicates, but
#     they may lack tools and technical proficiency to make a pull request that
#     splits one string into two or more different strings.
#
# Don't forget to run `npm run i18n:types` to update typings and check for
# possible errors.
#
# If you are actively working on the code, running `npm run i18n:watch` will
# run the type generator in watch mode, which will update the typings whenever
# any change is made here, as well as check for possible errors on the fly.
